# Regex Matcher on Haxe
Regex Parser + NFA(DFA) Builder + Regex Matcher

## Regular Expression Parser
The parser supports basic regular expression syntax.

+ Concatenation
+ Union `|`
+ Repeatation `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n, m}`,
+ Wildcard `.`
+ Character Classes `\w`, `\W`, `\d`, `\D`
+ Single Characters `[abc]`
+ Negation `[^...]`
+ Character Ranges `[a-z]`

## NFA(DFA) Builder
The NFA builder converts the AST generated by parser to the NFA(Non-deterministic Finite Automata).

The DFA builder converts the NFA to the DFA(Deterministic Finite Automata).

## Regex Matcher
There are several types of matcher for different algorithms.

### NFASingleMatcher
Single-state iteration on NFA(back tracking)

It is one of the standard algorithm.
But, as you know, catastrophic backtracking occurs in the worst case.

### NFAMultipleMatcher
Multi-state iteration on NFA

### DFAMatcher
Single-state iteration on DFA

So fast execution, but slow construction.

### DFA2Matcher
Multi-state iteration on NFA

It is similiar to NFAMultipleMatcher, but the states is allocated as needed and then cached in BST.
